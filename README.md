Implementation of Functional Programming Languages by Simon Peyton Jones.
This book is freely available to read from the following url from [Microsoft]
(http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/Papers/slpj-book-1987/).

I was bored so I decided to convert this book to a proper PDF. I don't think I am
going to do it in its entirety but if I do I will learn something in the process.
